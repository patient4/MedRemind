# **MedRemind Development Roadmap**

## **Phase 1: Project Initialization (1-2 Weeks)**
- [ ] Define project goals and objectives.
- [ ] Set up the development environment:
  - Install Django and dependencies.
  - Initialize SQLite database.
  - Set up Git for version control.
- [ ] Design database schema for core modules:
  - User authentication (patients, healthcare providers).
  - Personal health records.
  - Medication schedules.

## **Phase 2: Core Functionality Development (4-6 Weeks)**
### **Backend Development**
- [ ] Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
- [ ] Develop models and APIs for:
  - Personal health records.
  - Medication schedules with reminders.
  - Secure messaging.
- [ ] Create a health tracking module to log vitals (e.g., BP, heart rate).

### **Frontend Development**
- [ ] Design UI templates using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.
- [ ] Implement responsive layouts for:
  - Dashboard.
  - Medication schedule management.
  - Health record visualization.

## **Phase 3: Integration and Advanced Features (4-6 Weeks)**
- [ ] Integrate APIs for wearable devices and health apps:
  - Fetch data from devices (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Health).
  - Synchronize health tracking data.
- [ ] Build a secure messaging system:
  - End-to-end encryption.
  - Real-time chat between patients and providers.
- [ ] Add health education resources:
  - Articles and videos for common medical conditions.

## **Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (3-4 Weeks)**
- [ ] Conduct unit testing for backend APIs.
- [ ] Perform front-end testing for responsiveness and compatibility.
- [ ] Test integration with wearable devices and health apps.
- [ ] Optimize performance and database queries.

## **Phase 5: Deployment (2 Weeks)**
- [ ] Set up a production server (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
- [ ] Migrate SQLite database to a production-ready DB (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
- [ ] Deploy the application.
- [ ] Conduct final end-to-end testing on the live environment.

## **Phase 6: Post-Deployment Enhancements (Ongoing)**
- [ ] Gather user feedback and improve UX/UI.
- [ ] Monitor system performance and address bugs.
- [ ] Add features based on user requests:
  - AI-based health insights.
  - Multi-language support.
  - Advanced analytics and reporting tools.
